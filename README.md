# platformlint

`platformlint` explores platform engineering with a small PHP codebase and local fixtures. The technical goal is to lint service dependency and environment fixtures for deployability risks.

## Purpose

The project exists to keep a narrow engineering decision visible and testable. For this repo, that decision is how rollout width and route drift should influence a review result.

## Platformlint Review Notes

The first comparison I would make is `rollout width` against `rollout width` because it shows where the rule is most opinionated.

## What Is Covered

- `fixtures/domain_review.csv` adds cases for rollout width and quota pressure.
- `metadata/domain-review.json` records the same cases in structured form.
- `config/review-profile.json` captures the read order and the two review questions.
- `examples/platformlint-walkthrough.md` walks through the case spread.
- The PHP code includes a review path for `rollout width` and `rollout width`.
- `docs/field-notes.md` explains the strongest and weakest cases.

## Implementation Notes

The implementation keeps the scoring rule plain: reward signal and confidence, preserve slack, penalize drag, then classify the result into a review lane.

The PHP implementation avoids hidden state so fixture changes are easy to reason about.

## Command

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

## Audit Path

That command is also the regression path. It verifies the domain cases and catches mismatches between the CSV, metadata, and code.

## Limits

This remains a local project with deterministic fixtures. It does not depend on credentials, hosted services, or live data. Future work should add richer malformed inputs before widening the public API.
